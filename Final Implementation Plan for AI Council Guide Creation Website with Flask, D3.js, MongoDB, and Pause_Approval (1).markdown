# Final Implementation Plan for AI Council Guide Creation Website with Flask, D3.js, MongoDB, and Pause/Approval

## Context and Instructions for Claude

### App Description
The AI council guide creation website is a web application that enables users to create comprehensive guides on any topic by collaborating with an AI council (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini). Users input a topic, and the app orchestrates a multi-step process: research, outline creation, section drafting, editing, creative passes, and final review. Key features include:
- **Pause at Each Step**: The app pauses after each step (research, outline, drafting, editing, final review) to show AI queries, responses, and token costs, requiring user approval to proceed.
- **AI Interaction Tracking**: Queries sent to each AI, their responses (e.g., summaries, feedback), and token costs are logged and displayed for transparency.
- **User Approval**: Users review AI outputs and approve via a button before moving to the next step.
- **Creative Passes**: Users can trigger optional creative passes using random words to generate innovative ideas.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the AI council (select AIs) and word lists for creative passes.
- **Output**: Final guides are rendered as HTML/Markdown or PDF, with metadata (e.g., topic, AIs used).
- **User Interface**: A dashboard tracks progress, and a preview pane shows the guide’s current state, queries, responses, and costs.
- **Account Management**: Users create accounts to save and manage multiple guides.

The app is built with **Flask** (v2.3) for the backend API, **D3.js** (v7) for frontend visualization (e.g., progress bars, outlines) and DOM interaction (e.g., forms, buttons), **MongoDB** (v6) with `pymongo` for data storage, and **LangChain** (v0.2) for AI orchestration. It is deployed on Vercel (frontend), Heroku (backend), and MongoDB Atlas (database).

### Insights and Preferences
- **Flask**:
  - Use Blueprints for modularity (e.g., `research`, `guideOutput`).
  - Implement RESTful endpoints with JSON responses.
  - Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Use `gunicorn` for Heroku deployment.
- **D3.js**:
  - Leverage SVG for visualizations (e.g., progress bars, outline trees).
  - Ensure modularity with reusable functions (e.g., `researchViz`, `draftPreview`).
  - Follow WCAG 2.1 for accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
  - Use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles for maintainability.
- **MongoDB**:
  - Use `pymongo` for database operations.
  - Index collections (`guides`, `users`, `word_lists`) for performance.
  - Store AI interactions in `guides.ai_interactions` for query/response/cost tracking.
  - Use bcrypt for password hashing in `users`.
- **LangChain**:
  - Use `SequentialChain` for sequential tasks (e.g., research, drafting) and `AgentExecutor` for multi-AI tasks (e.g., draft review).
  - Log queries, responses, and token costs using `tiktoken` (ChatGPT), Anthropic’s estimator (Claude), and Gemini’s API metadata.
  - Cache results in MongoDB to handle API failures.
- **Performance**: Target <15-second task completion with MongoDB caching and optimized LangChain chains.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all D3.js UIs are WCAG 2.1 compliant.
- **Modularity**: Structure code in directories (e.g., `frontend/d3`, `backend/blueprints`, `langchain/chains`) for maintainability.
- **Testing**: Use Pytest for Flask and MongoDB, QUnit for D3.js, covering edge cases (e.g., API failures, invalid inputs).

### Advice
- **Complex Integrations**: For LangChain with multiple AIs, define clear input/output formats in prompts (e.g., JSON for queries/responses). Test API integrations incrementally.
- **D3.js Visualizations**: Start with simple SVG elements (e.g., rectangles for progress bars) before adding interactivity. Use D3’s data binding for dynamic updates.
- **Token Cost Tracking**: Implement lightweight token counters early (e.g., `tiktoken` for ChatGPT) to avoid overhead in production.
- **Pause/Approval Logic**: Store guide status in MongoDB (`paused_research`, `paused_outline`, etc.) and validate approval before proceeding.
- **Error Handling**: Anticipate API failures (e.g., Google Search downtime) by caching data in MongoDB and logging errors in `guides.ai_interactions`.
- **User Experience**: Ensure pause UIs are intuitive, with clear labels for queries, responses, and costs, and prominent approval buttons.

### Instructions to Claude
To streamline development and ensure high-quality code:
1. **Read This Context**: Before generating code for any task, review this section to understand the app’s purpose, technology stack, and preferences.
2. **Follow Prompt Details**: Adhere strictly to each task’s prompt, including specified versions (e.g., D3.js v7, Flask v2.3) and example outputs.
3. **Include Comments**: Add clear, concise comments explaining the purpose of each code block (e.g., `// Render SVG progress bar`).
4. **Avoid Deprecated Methods**: Use modern APIs (e.g., D3.js `select` instead of `d3.selectAll` for single elements, Flask `Blueprint` for routing).
5. **Ensure Modularity**: Write reusable functions (e.g., `researchViz` in D3.js, `research_bp` in Flask) and avoid global variables.
6. **Test Snippets**: Include a small test case or example usage in comments for critical functions (e.g., MongoDB queries, LangChain chains).
7. **Handle Edge Cases**: Account for errors (e.g., API failures, invalid inputs) and include fallback logic where specified.
8. **Validate Accessibility**: Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for D3.js UIs, ensuring WCAG 2.1 compliance.
9. **Optimize Performance**: Minimize database queries and API calls, using caching where appropriate.
10. **Ask for Clarification**: If a prompt is ambiguous, suggest a clarification (e.g., “Should the approval button trigger an API call immediately?”) but provide a default implementation.

## Overview
This implementation plan is optimized for AI-driven development using Cursor, Claude, and LangChain, with Flask for the backend API, D3.js for frontend visualization and DOM interaction, and MongoDB for data storage. It addresses user stories for the AI council guide creation website, incorporating functional requirements (e.g., topic input, research, creative passes, final review, pause at each step, query/response/cost tracking, user approval) and non-functional requirements (e.g., maintainability, modularity, performance). Tasks are modular, prompts are precise, and testing/error handling ensures robustness for AI execution.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: D3.js (v7) for visualization (e.g., progress bars, outlines, AI responses) and DOM interaction (e.g., forms, buttons).
- **Backend**: Flask (Python, v2.3) for API endpoints, integrated with MongoDB.
- **Database**: MongoDB (v6) with `pymongo` for storing guides, research, feedback, users, word lists, and AI interactions.
- **AI Orchestration**: LangChain (Python SDK, v0.2) to manage AI workflows, integrating Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and search APIs (e.g., Google Search).
- **Deployment**: Vercel for frontend hosting; Heroku for Flask backend; MongoDB Atlas for scalable database.
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes.
- **Testing**: Pytest (v8) for Flask API tests; QUnit (v2) for D3.js frontend tests.
- **Token Cost Tracking**: Use `tiktoken` for ChatGPT, Anthropic’s token estimator for Claude, and Gemini’s API metadata for token counts.

- **UI**: Task 17.1 supports UI tasks (e.g., 3.3, 5.2, 7.2).  
- **Feedback/Passes**: Tasks 4.1, 6.1, 10.1, 11.1 depend on their respective stages.  
- **Non-Functional**: Tasks 22.1, 23.1-23.4, 24.1-24.2 ensure quality and scalability.

## Non-Functional Considerations
- **Maintainability**: Modular D3.js functions, Flask Blueprints, and LangChain chains with documentation (Task 24.1) ensure easy updates.  
- **Modularity**: Separate directories and Blueprints (Task 24.2) allow swapping AI models or search APIs.  
- **Performance**: MongoDB caching and LangChain optimization (Task 23.1) target <15-second task completion, including query/response logging.  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance is embedded in D3.js tasks (Task 22.1).  
- **Security**: MongoDB authentication with bcrypt (Task 19.1) and input sanitization protect data.  
- **Scalability**: MongoDB indexing and load testing (Task 23.4) support 1,000 concurrent users.  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Token cost tracking (Tasks 3.1, 5.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 13.1) and API usage monitoring (Task 23.3) optimize expenses.

## Example Workflow
- **User Story 3 (Research)**: User submits "Starting a podcast" (Task 1.1). LangChain triggers a search, logging queries/responses/token costs in MongoDB (Task 3.1). Flask API handles the request (Task 3.2). D3.js shows progress, queries, responses, costs, and an approval button (Task 3.3). User provides feedback (Task 4.1) and approves, updating status to `paused_outline`.  
- **User Story 13 (Final Review)**: LangChain reviews the guide, logging interactions (Task 13.1). D3.js displays revisions, queries, responses, costs, and approval button (Task 13.2). A changelog is shown (Task 14.2). Approval sets status to `completed`.
